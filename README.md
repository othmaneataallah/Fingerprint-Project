# NOTES

`access.ino`, `delete.ino`, and `enroll.ino` contain the programs for figerprint recognition, fingerprint deletion, and fingerprint enrollment, respectively.

`fingerprint.ino` will contain the final program, which is still under development.

`R503 Datasheet.pdf` is the datasheet file for the fingerprint sensor used in the project.

We used the **2.1.3** version of the [Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library).
